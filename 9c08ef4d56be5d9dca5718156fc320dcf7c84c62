{"reviewRef":"refs/heads/ojarjur/sync-to-remote","targetRef":"refs/heads/master","requester":"ojarjur@google.com","reviewers":["amshali@google.com","bstanley@google.com"],"description":"Added a flag-controlled option to sync the mirrored repos (including git-notes) to their corresponding remotes. This makes the sync_git_notes script redundant, and should speed up the mirroring of reviews from remote repos."}
