{"reviewRef":"refs/heads/ojarjur/reduce-polling","targetRef":"refs/heads/master","requester":"ojarjur@google.com","reviewers":["amshali@google.com"," bstanley@google.com"],"description":"Reduce the amount of time spent polling the differential API, by only looking for open reviews when the local repo has changed.\n\nThis has the side-effect of making it so that if a previously abandoned review is re-opened, and then commented upon (from Phabricator), that we will not mirror those comments into the repo until the next time that repo is otherwise changed. However, that loss seems well worth it for the large reduction in API polling that this will buy us."}
