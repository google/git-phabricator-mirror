{"reviewRef":"refs/heads/ojarjur/fix-sync-issues","targetRef":"refs/heads/master","requester":"ojarjur@google.com","reviewers":["amshali@google.com","bstanley@google.com"],"description":"Fix two timing related bugs that were introduced by the change to make the mirror sync with the remote repo:\n\n1. Networking operations can cause some git commands involving remotes to hang forever, so we need to provide a timeout for every git command that involves a remote repo.\n2. The additional syncing behavior adds load to the remote repo, so we should throttle the mirroring if we are doing it (e.g. we don't want to run \"git fetch...\" several times per second)."}
