{"timestamp":"1447120105","author":"ckerur","description":"In general I am a little confused with the consolidation... It seems some code like ci.go have moved to git-appraise and we are just overwriting bits that are different .\n\nWhen reading this code in the future, are we to look at git-appraise as sort of the parent and then the mirror code ? Why do we have a file like comment.go... What is an example difference between what is in git-appraise and the code we are adding here ?"}
