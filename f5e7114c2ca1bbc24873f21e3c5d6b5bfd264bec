However, this isn't an expected scenario, but rather a \"something is seriously wrong\" scenario. Moreover, when we run this in the Phabricator Docker image, it is run by a supervisord which monitors it and restarts it if it fails.\n\nEssentially, the process kills itself so that when it gets restarted it continues on with a clean slate.\n\nI've added godoc to these methods to explicitly document that."}
