When either of these is not specified via environment variables, git tries to infer them from other means, which do not work in our managed VMs environment.\n\nWe were previously only specifying the author information. This meant that when we updated to a newer version of git, any attempts to create commits resulted in the commands failing.\n\nThis change adds environment variables for the new committer fields, with values that match the existing author environment variables."}
